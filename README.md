        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello, I'm Richard Montalvo, a dedicated Mechanical Engineer in the making, driven by a profound passion for engineering and robotics. As an aspiring mechanical engineer, I bring to the table 
            demonstrated technical and analytical skills, with a strong desire to further expand my understanding of mechanical processes, practices, and concepts. 
            Here's a glimpse of the projects I've had the privilege to work on:</p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Project 1: Fly Wheel Controls</h3>
        ![flywheel](https://github.com/R2montal/richardm-website/assets/91502833/589b99bc-ac39-43e5-8169-3c9e6a515892)

        <p>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> January 2023 - March 2023<br>
            <strong>Description:</strong> This project aims to design a flywheel mechanism control system that maintains a desired speed or position. The controllers are to maintain the flywheel's position, velocity, and acceleration within acceptable limits.<br>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Controller Selection, Data Analysis, Testing and Calibration, Documentation<br>
            <strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Control Systems Engineering, Mathematical Modeling, Controller Design and Implementation, Programming Skills, Experimental Testing, and Data Analysis.<br>
            <strong>Results:</strong> Allowed for advancement in controller design, improved system performance, and deeper understanding of control theory.
        </p>

        <h3>Project 2: Inventory Robot</h3>
